Indicator,Term,Explanation
"p Frac","Fractionalized Publications","The number of publications is presented as fractionalized counts, i.e. an author’s share of a publication is counted as 1/n where n denotes the number of authors."
"Wos Coverage",,"This percentage shows the coverage of the publications in Web of Science (WoS). The validity of bibliometric indicators are in general higher if the share of publications covered is high compared to a low coverage."
"cf", "Average Citation Rate", "The world average citation rate is 1.00, hence a value of 1.25 means that the publication has been cited 25 percent above world average. This indicator can appear to be high if just one or a few publications have received a high number of citations even though the rest of the publications have a low number of citations."
"Ptop10%", "", "The Ptop10%-indicator complements the cf-indicator and is less volatile since is not affected in the same extent by a few highly cited publications."
"C3", "C3", "The C3-indicator is presented both as the fractionalized sum of citations (C3 frac) and as the weighted average number of citations per publication (C3 mean frac)."
"Jcf frac", "Normalized citation rate for journals and serials", "This is the indicator used for funding allocation at KTH. It is meant to give incentives for publishing in high impact journals. Articles and Reviews are included. Citation rates are based on Web of Science. The Jcf-indicator is more stable than the cf-indicator. However, there is still reason to be cautious when interpreting values based on a low number of publications."
"Jtop20%", "The number and proportion of publications among the 20 percent most cited journals"
"P full", "Co-publishing", "The co-publishing indicators are presented as full counts, i.e. the publication is counted as 1 regardless of the number of authors or organizations. Co-publishing would otherwise be underestimated."
"P full",,"Full count of publications"
"P frac",,"Fractional count of publications"
"C full",,"Full count of citations"
"C frac",,"Fractionalized count of citations"
"C3 frac",,"Fractionalized count of citations with a three year window. The indicator shows the number of citations received from publications published the same year and the two following years. Since older publications have had more time to get cited than new publications, time series of citations counts using an open window are not appropriate. By using a fixed citation window of three years comparisons over time can be made."
"WoS coverage",,"Share of publications covered by Web of Science"
"cf Mean",,"Field normalized citation rate. This indicator normalizes for the variation of citation pattern between subject fields. Each publication is compared to a reference group of publications, i.e. publications within the same Web of Science subject category, published the same year and of the same document type (article or review). This is done by dividing the number of citations of each publication with the average number of citations for the reference group of publications, which results in a normalized citation rate. The indicator value expresses the field normalized average citation rate of the unit’s publications. It follows from the definition of cf that the mean field normalized citation rate of all records in the Web of Science database is 1. A citation rate above one indicatesthat the set of publications is cited above world average, e.g. a citation rate of 1.2 indicates that the publications are cited 20 percent above world average."
"Ptopx%",,"The number/share of publications among the x percent most cited. The same reference group as for the field normalized citation rate is used for the indicator. Publications can partly belong to the x percent most cited publications if several publications have the same citation value as the percentile limit or if the publication has been classified into multiple fields with different percentile limits."
jcf,,"Mean field normalized citation rate for journals and serials. This indicator shows the citation impact of the journals in which the unit has published. It is calculated as an average of the field normalized citation rate of the set of journals in which the analyzed unit has published. If the unit has published multiple articles in the same journal, the journal’s citation rate is counted one time for each article. This journal
indicator is normalized for field differences by the same principles as the field normalized citation rate (cf). For a publication published in the year x, the value of the journal is based on the years x-1 to x-5."
"JtopX%",,"The number/share of publications that have been published in journals which are among the X percent most cited. The same reference group as for the journals’ field normalized citation rate (jcf) is used for the indicator. The journals in the topX% category publish X percent of the publications in the reference group. A journal can partly belong to the topX% percent if it stretches over the percentile limit or if it has been classified into multiple fields with different percentile limits. International co-publishing This indicator shows the number of publications that has been co-published between two or more countries. The default presentation of this indicator is by full counts."
"Swe. non-univ. co-publishing",,"This indicator shows the number of publications that has been co-published between a university and Swedish non-university organizations. The default presentation of this indicator is by full counts."
