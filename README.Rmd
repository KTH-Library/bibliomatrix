The goal of bibliomatrix is to provide a common set of functionality for the Annual Bibliometric Monitoring efforts from the Bibliometrics team at the KTH Library.

## Installation

You can install the latest development version of bibliomatrix from [GitHub](https://KTH-Library.github.com/bibliomatrix) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("KTH-Library/bibliomatrix")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to get some data when creating Annual Bibliometric Monitoring analytics:

```{r example, , warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(bibliomatrix)
library(dplyr)

# simple example showing how to filter some of the data for Table 1
# in the ABM report for an organizational unit and restrict the
# output to a specific set of columns

abm_tab1() %>% 
# only show data given a specific unit id (KTH = 177), just five records
filter(id == 177) %>%
select(`Organizational Unit`, `Publication Type`, `WoS Coverage`) %>%
slice(1:5) %>%
knitr::kable()

```

This is a basic example of how to retrieve data for the organizational units used in the Annual Bibliometric Monitoring:

```{r}
# get data for organizational units at 
# level 1 (KTH), level 2 (Schools) and level 3 (Departments / Institutions)
# NB: this table is not yet complete and some entries lack english translations

org <- abm_units()

# inspect some organizational unit ids at "level 2" ie at the school level

org %>%
filter(unit_level == 2) %>%
knitr::kable()

```

Some data relating to a specific school using the organizational unit id:

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

abm_tab1() %>%
filter(id == 879223) %>%
select(-id, -pubtype_order, -c(starts_with("20"))) %>%
# just show five rows
slice(1:5) %>%
knitr::kable()
```

## Development

To further develop or change the package, please refer to instructions at <http://r-pkgs.org/>, then fork this repo, clone it, make the changes and whe done, submit a PR with the changes.

If you wish to work from the CLI, you can use this approach:

<https://github.com/KTH-Library/kontarion#contributions>

For a concrete example - to make a change with regards to adding tests, follow instructions for how to [add a test](https://r-pkgs.org/tests.html) and add it in `test/testthat/` making sure that it verifies expected results, then do the Ctrl+Shift+{D,T,E} steps (if using keyboard shortcuts) and then use git to commit and push the changes to your fork, then issue a PR.
